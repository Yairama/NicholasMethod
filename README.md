This code is a small program that uses
the nicolás method to determine the type of exploitation method to be used in a mine.
The entire graphical interface is programmed in java swing and no additional libraries are used.

## About

#### Text extracted from the original publication on linkedin
Some years ago while I was just learning to program in Java I did a small project as a practice to reinforce what I had learned, that project was a small program to select the appropriate method of mining using the Nicholas algorithm (in which I was studying in the 5th cycle) and thanks to that little application opened the doors to the world of work.

Today after reviewing my GitLab repositories I found it again and I laughed at the crude and novice programming techniques I had at that time.

I would like to share this little application with all of you in an Open Source way so you can use it as you wish, so at the end I will leave the download link and the link to the GitLab repository where you can see all the code and use it as you wish without any problem.

PST: If there is any mining algorithm that you consider convenient to program, let me know! I'm still learning and that helps me to reinforce my mining and technological side. I will develop it completely Open Source.
